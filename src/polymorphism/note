Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are
related to each other by inheritance. The most common use of polymorphism in OOP occurs
when a parent class reference is used to refer to a child class object.

Any Java object that can pass more than one IS-A test is considered to be polymorphic.
In Java, all Java objects are polymorphic since any object will pass the IS-A test for
their own type and for the class Object.
