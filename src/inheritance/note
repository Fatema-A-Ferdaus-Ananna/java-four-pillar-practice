In inheritance, we can create a new class that is inherited by another class. So the new class we can refer to as a
child/subclass and the class which already exists refer to a parent/superclass. One object acquires all the
behaviors and properties of a parent object, and when you inherit a child class from a parent class you can reuse
fields and methods of that class.

Types of inheritance in java

1) Single        [ superclass <- subclass]
2) Multilevel    [ superclass <- subclass <- sub-subclass
3) Hierarchical  [ superclass <- subclass1, superclass <- subclass2]

In java programming, multiple and hybrid inheritance is supported through interface only.

4) Multiple   [ superclass1,superclass2 <- subclass
5) Hybrid     [ superclass <- subclass1,subclass2 <- hybridclass
