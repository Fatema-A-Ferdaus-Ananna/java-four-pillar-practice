-> Encapsulation is also known as data hiding.
-> Encapsulation in Java is a mechanism of wrapping the data (variables) and code acting on
the data (methods) together as a single unit.
-> the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only
through the methods of their current class.


To achieve encapsulation in Java âˆ’

    1] Declare the variables of a class as private.
    2] Provide public setter and getter methods to modify and view the variables values.

Benefits of Encapsulation
    The fields of a class can be made  -> i)  read-only or [getter]
                                          ii) write-only   [setter]
    A class can have total control over what is stored in its fields.
